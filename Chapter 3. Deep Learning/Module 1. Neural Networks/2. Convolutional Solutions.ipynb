    "\n",
    "- On average, each neuron will \"fire\" with `1-p` probability (activation's expected value)\n",
    "- They will have to output higher values in order to compensate for signal loss during training phase\n",

    "\n",
    "### Sparsity (most important weights)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dropout pushes distributions of activations towards zero\n",
    "- Neural network focuses more on the important weights and important output neurons\n",
    "- We get a model that is __easier to reason about__ (not to confuse with easy!)\n",
    "- __Breaks co-adaptation__ (multiple neurons do similar tasks, hence decision boundary is less clear)\n",
    "- Due to above, generalization is likely to improve as the most important features are considered (most important factor according to original authors)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling rationale - Monte Carlo sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save each model created during forward pass (__a lot of models__!) randomly (`k=50` used) during training (preferably after some training passed)\n",
    "- Ask each one to predict on test\n",
    "- Average their results\n",
    "- __Results similar to just multiplying activation by expected value (within one standard deviation)!__\n",
