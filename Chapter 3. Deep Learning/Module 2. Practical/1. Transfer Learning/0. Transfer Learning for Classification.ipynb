    "## Loading in pretrained model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's make our classifier model. \n",
    "This is where the transfer learning takes place.\n",
    "For the first part of our model, we pass our data through a pre-trained model. \n",
    "For our pre-trained model, we will use [VGG11](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_vgg/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a diagram of the VGG11 architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/vgg11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't pass our data through the whole model though. \n",
    "This is because VGG is trained to output a probability distribution over more than 20K classes. \n",
    "It's not those class confidences that will be helpful to us, but the features that were combined in the last few layers of the VGG11 neural network to compute them.\n",
    "As such, we can use the pre-trained model as a **feature extractor** by passing our data not all of the way through model, but through most of it, such that what it outputs is a set of activation maps, which represent where and by how much complex features of the image are present.\n",
    "These high-level features are the ones which VGG11 learnt when being trained to perform it's original task.\n",
    "Our hope is that these same features will be useful for our new task.\n",
    "This here is the transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To relate that to the image shown below, what we will do is take the first convolutional layers (shown as grids of circles rather than vectors) which contain the activation maps for high level features, and discard the fully connected layers on the end and replace them with our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/features.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we get the feature maps of the input from VGG11, we will flatten them and stack a few extra linear layers on the end. These layers will culminate in a single node which represents the confidence of an image being a hotdog, as opposed to a dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our input data needs to be transformed to have the input size which VGG11 expects. And our additional layers will have to expect inputs with the same shape as the output from the VGG11 feature extractor. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fine tuning our model\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, our extra linear layers will have initially random weights, so we'll need to train them.\n",
    "But we know that the VGG model weights are probably pretty close to what we want, so we don't want to adjust them (too much).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Weight freezing\n",
    "\n",
    "We will **freeze** the VGG weights so that they don't change, whilst we train our final layer weights in the usual way.\n",
    "We do this by setting the ```requires_grad``` attribute of the VGG weights to false.\n",
    "This means that when we backpropagate our error, it's rate of change with respect to these weights is not computed, and they are not updated when we call ```loss.backward()```.\n",
    "By only adjusting the extra layers which we added, we effectively **fine-tune** VGG11 to our task, whilst taking advantage of what it has already learnt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: Discriminative learning rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively to freezing the VGG model's weights, we can use a smaller learning rate so that they are still updated, but not as much as our fine-tuning layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which should I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Freezing the weights by setting their ```requires_grad``` attribute to true will remove them from the computational graph and will increase the speed at which you can make updates by preventing you having to compute their gradients, compute the optimisation step and then update their values. However, if your pretrained model was trained on a significantly different dataset, you may need to update its weights to fine-tune it to your specific problem to achieve the desired level of performance. In this case, using discriminitive learning rates may be a better approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get our pretrained model from torchvision (PyTorch's computer vision library) and build our model which uses transfer learning."
