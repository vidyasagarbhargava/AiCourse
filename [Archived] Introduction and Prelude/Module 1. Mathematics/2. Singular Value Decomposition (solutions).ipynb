    "__Orthogonalization__ is the process where, given a set of vectors, we output a corresponding orthogonal set of vectors. When we want the output vectors to have unit length, the process is instead called __orthonormalization__. The __Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization Process__ is one of the methods through which we can orthogonalize a set of vectors. It is an important concept that we will meet again once we deal with singular value decomposition.\n",

Given that we can represent the data in a new form, it is useful for data reduction, and even the basis of __principal component analysis (PCA)__, which we will cover in a later section.\n",
