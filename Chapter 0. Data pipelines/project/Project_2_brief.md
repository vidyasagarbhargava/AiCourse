In order to pass you need to meet the following 4 criteria:
- You scraped a decent amount of data (in the 1000s minimum)
- Your data is accessible in a database or csv format
- Your data is clean and ready to use in a machine learning problem
- You have identified a variable in your dataset that can be predicted using some of the remaining variables

How you will get points for this project:

## Readability (1 point each)

### Readme
Your repository has a readme file.
It summarises what you achieved
It contains enough to make potential employers want to read your code

### Comments
You added comments explaining each decision and docstrings for each function/class

### Clean repo
Your repo contains all the elements necessary to run your code
Your repo does not contain depricated files
Your repo's structure helps the reader know what the should do first

## Technical ability (1 point each)

### Object Oriented Programming
You created and used functions
You created and used classes
You handled exceptions properly
your classes/functions live in .py files 

### Data cleaning 
Your structured data contains a single variable per column
You handled duplicates and nulls properly
You have identified a variable that you would like to predict based on some of the remaining variables

## Presentation (1 point each)
You used slides and they are part of the repository
Your presentation lasted between 5 and 15 minutes (please, rehearse)

## Extra points (1 per item)
Your data is in a SQL DB
You demonstrate that you have run your code in the cloud
Your data contains way more than 1 million rows
Your data contains structured data + free text + images
You used 2 or more sources of data in your project
You performed a partial live demo during your presentation (and it goes well)
